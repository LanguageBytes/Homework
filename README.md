## Semantic HTML elements

 In order to make the webpage more informative and adaptable, I have substituted div elements for semantic elements, e.g nav, section, article, figure, and aside, where possible in the HTML file. This should make the document more readable for other developers and improve SEO by allowing browsers and search engines to better interpret its content. I was unsure as to whether I should use a header tag for the h2 tags? 

## Adding Comments

In order to provide clarity for other developers accessing the code, I have added comments to the HTML and CSS files and rearranged the structure in order of appearance on the site.

On the one hand, adding details about the image could provide a richer, more inclusive experience for those with visual imparements using screen readers, but on the other hand, I had read that alt text needs to be consise and keyword stuffing must be avoided to avoid Google Penalties. I was not sure how to best to describe the icon images.

## Responsive Design

In order to make sure that the website would fit all browsers I added in a meta viewport tag in the head section and added in media query in the css. In theory, this should help prevent the formatting from becoming corrupted on smaller screens. I also added in a reset.css file to avoid any default formatting issues with the browser.

## Checking Links

The first link "Search Engine Optimisation" was missing an id. I added an id so that when clicked it should direct the user to the section in the article about SEO.

## Thoughts on Task

Overall, this task was ok. I feel I may have missed something important. I had to do some research into SEO as I am not confident in what the standards are.I was
