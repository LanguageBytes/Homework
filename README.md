# Commentary of Changes Made

Please see below for an explanation of the changes I have made.

## Adding in Semantic HTML elements

 In order to make the webpage more informative and adaptable, I have substituted <div> where possible for semantic elements <nav> <section> <article> and <aside> in the HTML document. 


### Adding in Alt Text

I added in alt text in order to meet accecibility standards. 

### How I Found This Task

Overall, this task was ok. I feel I may have missed something important. I had to do some research into SEO as I am not confident in what the standards are. When reading about HTML5 semantic  elements, I was slightly confused about when I would use <article> and when to use <section>?
