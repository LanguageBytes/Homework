# Commentary of Changes Made

Please see below for an explanation of the changes I made and why I amde them.

## User Story

A user story, or persona, is a description of an application using natural, non-technical language. Written from the perspective of the application’s end user, they help developers organize their work by allowing them to understand an application’s context and who will be using it.

### Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria are the requirements that must be met to complete a user story. They define the boundaries of the user story and are used to confirm when a story is completed.

These criteria can be thought of as instructions for how you should complete a homework assignment. As you plan how to build the application, use them to structure your pages and pseudocode your logic. As you’re working, look back at the list of acceptance criteria to make sure you’ve met all of them. An application is complete only when it meets all of these criteria.

### Review

In the real world, when a developer finishes working on an issue, another developer reviews the code, providing feedback on errors and making sure that all of the acceptance criteria have been met. For the homework assignments, your TAs will serve as your reviewers.

To submit your application for review, you are required to provide the following:

* The URL of the deployed application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository. Give the repository a unique name and include a README describing the project.
