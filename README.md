## Semantic HTML elements and SEO

 In order to make the webpage more informative and adaptable, I have substituted div elements for semantic elements, e.g nav, section, article, figure, and aside, where possible in the HTML file. This should make the document more readable for other developers and improve SEO by allowing browsers and search engines to better interpret its content. In order to improve SEO, I added in a meta description tag so which will appear when the website is featured in search results or sent as a link. I chose to display the name of the organisation as the site's title to be consistent with the rest of the site.

## Adding Comments

To provide clarity for other developers accessing the code, I have added comments to the HTML and CSS files and rearranged the structure in order of appearance on the site.

## Alt Text

 To meet accessibility standards, I added in alt text. I tried to be descriptive whilst keeping under 125 characters. Adding details about the image could provide a richer, more inclusive experience for those with visual imparements using screen readers.

## Responsive Design

In order to make sure that the website would fit all browsers I added in a meta viewport tag in the head section and added in media query in the css. In theory, this should help prevent the formating from becoming corrupted on smaller screens. I also added in a reset.css file to avoid any default formatting issues with the browser.

## Checking Links and Changing 

The first link "Search Engine Optimisation" was missing an id. I added an id so that when clicked it should direct the user to the section in the article about SEO. Originally, the class for the Cover Image was called 'hero', I changed this to 'services' as it seemed like a more appropriate name.

## Thoughts on Task

Overall, I feel I may have missed some important elements. I am not fully confident in what the standards are for SEO and limitations of google.this is something that I would like to do further research into after completing this task. I was unsure as to whether I should use a header tag for the h2 tags? Although adding details about the image could provide a richer, more inclusive experience for those with visual imparements using screen readers, on the other hand, I had read that alt text needs to be consise and keyword stuffing must be avoided to avoid Google Penalties.  I was not sure how to best to describe the icon images.
